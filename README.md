# Implementing a Recommendation System on IMDB Dataset through Machine Learning Techniques. 

Although machine learning (ML) is commonly used in building recommendation systems, it doesn’t mean it’s the only solution. In this Project we go through an approach where we don’t use any ML model to predict the recommendations.
There are different approaches in designing a recommender system,but lets focus on these 3 techniques with an practical Example:-

1)Content Based Filtering
2)Collaborative Filtering
3)Rating Based Filtering

     We are Building a Recommender System based on Ratings,
   
  Based on higher ratings and number of reviews,number of votes movies can be recommended. Here Correlation comes into act. We compare the one movie ratings given by all users  
  with the another movie ratings given by all users, thus we find some correlation between movies from all user’s perspective.
